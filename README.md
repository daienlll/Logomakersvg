Desc:
Logomakersvg is a simple command-line application that allows you to create a simple three character logo.

Params: The application will prompt the user to input short text, a text color, a shape choice, and a shape background color. The short text can be up to three characters, the colors may be input using color names or hexadecimal codes, and you can choose between Triangle, Square, and Circle for your shapes.

Tests: The tests run through three different configurations of logo to ensure the application works as intended. This includes shape generation with color for each shape.
